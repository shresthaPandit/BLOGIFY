# 🧪 Local Testing Guide

## ✅ S3 Configuration Test Results
Your AWS S3 configuration is **WORKING PERFECTLY**! 

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All environment variables set correctly
- ✅ Bucket access successful
- ✅ Upload permissions working
- ✅ Delete permissions working
- ✅ Found existing images in bucket (including profile images!)

## 🚀 How to Test Locally

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your server should start on `http://localhost:8001`

### 2. Test User Registration with Profile Image
1. Open `http://localhost:8001/user/signup`
2. Fill in the registration form
3. **Upload a profile image** (this is the key test!)
4. Submit the form
5. Check the console logs for S3 upload confirmation

### 3. Test Profile Update
1. Sign in to your account
2. Go to `http://localhost:8001/user/profile`
3. Try updating your profile image
4. Check if the new image appears correctly

### 4. Test Blog Creation with Images
1. Go to `http://localhost:8001/blog/add-new`
2. Create a new blog post
3. Upload a cover image
4. Submit the blog
5. Verify the image appears on the blog post

### 5. Check Console Logs
Look for these success messages in your terminal:
```
✅ S3 connection successful - Bucket: imageinsidebucket-93899-2025
✅ New user profile image uploaded to S3: https://...
✅ Profile image updated in S3: https://...
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Images upload to S3 successfully
- Image URLs start with `https://imageinsidebucket-93899-2025.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/`
- No errors in browser console
- No errors in server console

### ❌ Problem Indicators
- Images not appearing
- Error messages in console
- Images still using local paths (`/uploads/...`)
- 404 errors for image URLs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Images Don't Upload:
1. **Check environment variables** - Run `node test-s3.js` again
2. **Check file size** - Images must be under 5MB
3. **Check file type** - Only image files allowed
4. **Check network** - Ensure internet connection

### If Images Don't Display:
1. **Check S3 bucket permissions** - Ensure bucket is publicly readable
2. **Check image URLs** - Should be S3 URLs, not local paths
3. **Check browser console** - Look for 404 errors
